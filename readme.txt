I have an aversion to repetitive non-value added tasks. So much so I did an 
entire Python course (on Udemy) entitled Automate the Boring Stuff. 
I applied the principles learnt to other languages, in this case
Powershell, to automate repetitive daily tasks. These are two typical examples:
one personal, one professional.
